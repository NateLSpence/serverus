              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>General Wordpress Setup</h4>
                <p>You should check out the Settings pages and decide what will be best for your site. The most important ones to look at are General, Reading, Forums, and bbPress Moderation.</p>
                <p class="text-warning">Note that "Writing" and "Discussion" aren't very useful to you, since those default WordPress functions aren't in use with Serverus. Also, anything referencing blog posts/comments are defunct. Serverus is for forums, and removes the default blogging platform.</p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>Front Page Setup</h4>
                <p>Like most forums, you can have your front page display news. This will display the latest topics from a single forum (for example, "Server News"), newest first, without any of the replies attached to them.</p>
                <img src="dist/img/front_page.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
                <p>Edit the front page to adjust these options.</p>
                <img src="dist/img/frontpage_edit.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
                <p>Serverus uses a shortcode to determine which forum to get news from, and to set some options:</p>
                <p><code>[srv_frontpage forum_id=# posts_per_page=5 char_limit=0 show_stickies=false]</code></p>
                <p>Firstly, <code>forum_id=#</code> is the ID of the forum to display. <strong>Browse to a forum to find its ID</strong> (only Admins and Mods see them). Use a number here; no quotes or symbols.</p>
                <img src="dist/img/forum_id.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
                <p>Then, <code>posts_per_page=5</code> decides how many posts to display on the front page before you have to click "Next".</p>
                <p>The option <code>char_limit=0</code> is the maximum length, in characters, to display for each post. 0 means there is no limit.</p>
                <p>Lastly, <code>show_stickies=false</code> decides whether or not to display "sticky" threads in your news page. Use <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> here.</p>

                <br>

                <p>An example of a customized shortcode might look like this:</p>
                <p><code>[srv_frontpage forum_id=12 posts_per_page=20 char_limit=450 show_stickies=false]</code></p>
                <p>In this example, our front page will display posts from the forum with the ID of 12. It will display a maximum of 20 posts, but only the first 450 characters from each. Sticky threads won't be displayed.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Remember to click "Update" when you're finished editing the page.</p>

                <p>These are basically the same, but as an administrator you might find them both useful. In the WordPress menus, you can see all of the users in a list, instead of digging through posts to find a specific person. Making quick tweaks might be easier from the forum profile view.</p>

                <p>From either a user's profile view or from the "Users" menu, you can set a user to "Blocked" as their forum role to ban them.

                <p>If you're getting an error along the lines of "404 page not found" then you probably need to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Using_.22Pretty.22_permalinks" target="_blank">enable Pretty Permalinks and mod_rewrite</a>. If you're having trouble with this, contact your web host's support.</p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>I just see a white screen!</h4>
                <p>This is what WordPress does when it breaks. What is the very last thing you did before you saw the white screen? If you just enabled the theme, or one of the plugins, your best bet is to follow <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Common_WordPress_Errors#The_White_Screen_of_Death" target="_blank">WordPress's help guide</a>. After that, double-check that you've updated WordPress, bbPress, and Serverus itself to their latest versions. Double-check the <a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> section. Lastly, remember that bbPress must be activated for Serverus to work properly. Disabling it while Serverus is activated might cause issues.</p>

                <h4>When I add a widget, it collapses and I can't see the options.</h4>
                <p>Click the "Save" button after you add the widget, and it should expand again. If it doesn't, try refreshing the page.</p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>Dropdown menus aren't working.</h4>
                <p>Most likely, this is being caused by the Easy Bootstrap Shortcodes plugin. If you haven't configured it yet, check out the <a href="#ebs-help">directions for configuring it</a> and make sure you've done this.</p>
                <p class="text-info">This problem is usually because the dropdown.js plugin in Bootstrap is being included twice. Serverus is built on Bootstrap, so it doesn't need bootstrap.js included again. If the above directions don't fix your problem, see if there's another reason you might have bootstrap.js (which comes with dropdown.js in it) being included a second time.</p>
