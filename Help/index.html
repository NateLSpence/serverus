                <p>You'll need a <a href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/">host and domain name</a> with an updated version of WordPress installed in order to use Serverus.</p>
                <p>Your web host might have an option to install WordPress automatically, or you may have to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download and install it yourself</a>.</p>
                <p>Once you have WordPress up and running, log in.</p>
                <p class="text-info small">As administrator, you'll see the WordPress Admin Toolbar at the top of the webpage- other users won't see this. You'll also be able to see IP addresses and extra buttons on posts for moderation. Blocked/muted users and posts will be visible to you, but not regular users. Otherwise, what you see is what your users will see for the most part.</p>

            <section id="setup" class="col-12 col-xs-12">
              <h2>Setup</h2>
              
              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>Front Page Setup</h4>
                <p>Like most forums, you can have your front page display news. This will display the latest topics from a single forum (for example, "Server News"), newest first, without any of the replies attached to them.</p>
                <p>Serverus uses a shortcode to determine which forum to get news from, and to set some options:</p>
                <p><code>[srv_frontpage forum_id=# posts_per_page=5 char_limit=0 show_stickies=false]</code></p>
                <p>Firstly, <code>forum_id=#</code> is the ID of the forum to display. Browse to a forum to find its ID (only Admins and Mods see them). Use a number here; no quotes or symbols.</p>
                <p>Then, <code>posts_per_page=5</code> decides how many posts to display on the front page before you have to click "Next".</p>
                <p>The option <code>char_limit=0</code> is the maximum length, in characters, to display for each post. 0 means there is no limit.</p>
                <p>Lastly, <code>show_stickies=false</code> decides whether or not to display "sticky" threads in your news page. Use <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> here.</p>

                <br>

                <p>An example of a customized shortcode might look like this:</p>
                <p><code>[srv_frontpage forum_id=15 posts_per_page=20 char_limit=450 show_stickies=false]</code></p>
                <p>In this example, our front page will display posts from the forum with the ID of 15. It will display a maximum of 20 posts, but only the first 450 characters from each. Sticky threads won't be displayed.</p>

              </div>

              <div id="forums-setup" class="subsection">
                <h4>Forums Setup</h4>
                <p>Under the Forums menu, create the forums you want, along with categories to put them under. <span class="text-danger">All forums require a category</span>, even if everything is under one category.</p>

                <h4>Enable Registration</h4>
                <p>To open your forums to the world, you'll have to enable registration in order for users to make their own account. Make sure "Anyone can register" is checked under Settings. Alternatively, you can opt to add users manually via the Users menu.</p>

                <h4>Modify Users</h4>
                <p>There are two places you can edit a user's information- the Users menu from the WordPress menus, or by clicking on the user's name in the forums and viewing their profile. These are basically the same, but as an administrator you might find them both useful. In the WordPress menus, you can see all of the users in a list, instead of digging through posts to find a specific person. Making quick tweaks might be easier from the forum profile view.</p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <h4>Moderation</h4>
                <p>If you've installed the bbPress Moderation plugin, this is a pretty simple process. Individual posts have buttons for moderation, and you can set a user to "Blocked" as their forum role to ban them. Setting a user to "Moderator" gives them the ability to edit other users/posts and see a minimal version of the WordPress administration menus.</p>

                <p>This is what WordPress does when it breaks. What is the very last thing you did before you saw the white screen? If you just enabled the theme, or one of the plugins, your best bet is to follow <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Common_WordPress_Errors#The_White_Screen_of_Death">WordPress's help guide</a>. After that, double-check that you've updated WordPress, bbPress, and Serverus itself to their latest versions. Double-check the <a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> section. Lastly, remember that bbPress must be activated for Serverus to work properly. Disabling it while Serverus is activated might cause issues.</p>
